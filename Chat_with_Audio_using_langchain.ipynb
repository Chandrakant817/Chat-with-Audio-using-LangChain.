Use `--language` to specify the language Detected language: English [00:00.000 --> 00:08.880]  I might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines, but I wanted [00:08.880 --> 00:15.280]  you to see every step by which we came, I to agree to whatever Marguerite wished, Marguerite [00:15.280 --> 00:18.680]  to be unable to live apart from me. [00:18.680 --> 00:25.120]  It was the day after the evening when she came to see me that I sent her Manon Lascotte. [00:25.120 --> 00:30.920]  From that time, seeing that I could not change my mistress's life, I changed my own. [00:30.920 --> 00:36.000]  I wished above all not to leave myself time to think over the position I had accepted, [00:36.000 --> 00:41.120]  for, in spite of myself, it was a great distress to me. [00:41.120 --> 00:48.520]  Thus my life, generally so calm, assumed all at once an appearance of noise and disorder. [00:48.520 --> 00:53.800]  Never believe, however disinterested the love of a kept woman may be, that it will cost [00:53.800 --> 00:55.680]  one nothing. [00:55.680 --> 01:01.660]  Nothing is so expensive as their caprices, flowers, boxes at the theatre, suppers, days [01:01.660 --> 01:06.600]  in the country, which one can never refuse to one's mistress. [01:06.600 --> 01:09.440]  As I have told you, I had little money. [01:09.440 --> 01:14.080]  My father was, and still is, Receiver General at sea. [01:14.080 --> 01:19.400]  He has a great reputation there for loyalty, thanks to which he was able to find the security [01:19.400 --> 01:23.040]  which he needed in order to attain this position. [01:23.080 --> 01:29.680]  I came to Paris, studied law, was called to the bar, and, like many other young men, put [01:29.680 --> 01:36.720]  my diploma in my pocket, and let myself drift, as one so easily does in Paris. [01:36.720 --> 01:42.200]  My expenses were very moderate, only I used up my year's income in eight months and spent [01:42.200 --> 01:47.240]  the four summer months with my father, which practically gave me twelve thousand francs [01:47.240 --> 01:52.340]  a year, and, in addition, the reputation of a good son. [01:52.340 --> 01:55.580]  For the rest, not a penny of debt. [01:55.580 --> 02:00.100]  This, then, was my position when I made the acquaintance of Marguerite. [02:00.100 --> 02:06.460]  You can well understand that, in spite of myself, my expenses soon increased. [02:06.460 --> 02:11.980]  Marguerite's nature was very capricious, and, like so many women, she never regarded as [02:11.980 --> 02:17.620]  a serious expense those thousand and one distractions which made up her life. [02:17.660 --> 02:22.500]  So, wishing to spend as much time with me as possible, she would write to me in the [02:22.500 --> 02:27.900]  morning that she would dine with me, not at home, but at some restaurant in Paris, or [02:27.900 --> 02:29.500]  in the country. [02:29.500 --> 02:34.620]  I would call for her, and we would dine and go on to the theatre, often having supper [02:34.620 --> 02:36.100]  as well. [02:36.100 --> 02:40.580]  Forgive me if I give you all these details, but you will see that they were the cause [02:40.580 --> 02:42.620]  of what was to follow. [02:42.620 --> 02:47.740]  What I tell you is a true and simple story, and I leave to it all the naïveté of its [02:47.740 --> 02:52.620]  details and all the simplicity of its developments. [02:52.620 --> 02:58.260]  I realized, then, that as nothing in the world would make me forget my mistress, it was needful [02:58.260 --> 03:02.740]  for me to find some way of meeting the expenses into which she drew me. [03:02.740 --> 03:09.580]  Then, too, my love for her had so disturbing an influence upon me that every moment I spent [03:09.580 --> 03:14.780]  away from Marguerite was like a year, and that I felt the need of consuming these moments [03:14.780 --> 03:20.500]  in the fire of some sort of passion, as not to know that I was living them. [03:20.500 --> 03:25.500]  I began by borrowing five or six thousand francs on my little capital, and with this [03:25.500 --> 03:27.420]  I took to gambling. [03:27.420 --> 03:31.460]  Since gambling houses were destroyed, gambling goes on everywhere. [03:31.460 --> 03:37.220]  Formerly, when one went to Friscati, one had the chance of making a fortune, one played [03:37.220 --> 03:42.180]  against money, and if one lost, there was always the consolation of saying that one [03:42.180 --> 03:43.980]  might have gained. [03:43.980 --> 03:49.660]  Whereas now, except in the clubs, where there is still a certain rigor in regard to payments, [03:49.660 --> 03:55.740]  one is almost certain, the moment one gains a considerable sum, not to receive it. [03:55.740 --> 03:58.560]  You will readily understand why. [03:58.560 --> 04:03.540]  Gambling is only likely to be carried on by young people, very much in need of money, [04:04.380 --> 04:07.940]  the fortune necessary for supporting the life they lead. [04:07.940 --> 04:13.480]  They gamble then, and with this result, or else they gain, and then those who lose serve [04:13.480 --> 04:18.260]  to pay for their horses and mistresses, which is very disagreeable. [04:18.260 --> 04:23.420]  Debts are contracted, acquaintances begun about a green table end by quarrels in which [04:23.420 --> 04:29.860]  life or honor comes to grief, and though one may be an honest man, one finds oneself ruined [04:29.860 --> 04:37.140]  by very honest men, whose only defect is that they have not 200,000 francs a year. [04:37.140 --> 04:40.340]  I need not tell you of those who cheat at play. [04:40.340 --> 04:46.140]  I flung myself into this rapid, noisy, and volcanic life, which had formerly terrified [04:46.140 --> 04:50.840]  me when I thought of it, and which had become for me the necessary complement of my love [04:50.840 --> 04:52.620]  for Marguerite. [04:52.620 --> 04:54.860]  What else could I have done? [04:54.860 --> 05:00.540]  The nights that I did not spend in the Rue d'Antin, if I had spent them alone in my own room, [05:00.540 --> 05:02.500]  I could not have slept. [05:02.500 --> 05:07.060]  Jealousy would have kept me awake, and inflamed my blood and my thoughts. \n"

              "\" Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds. Use `--language` to specify the language Detected language: English [00:00.000 --> 00:08.880]  I might have told you of the beginning of this liaison in a few lines, but I wanted [00:08.880 --> 00:15.280]  you to see every step by which we came, I to agree to whatever Marguerite wished, Marguerite [00:15.280 --> 00:18.680]  to be unable to live apart from me. [00:18.680 --> 00:25.120]  It was the day after the evening when she came to see me that I sent her Manon Lascotte. [00:25.120 --> 00:30.920]  From that time, seeing that I could not change my mistress's life, I changed my own. [00:30.920 --> 00:36.000]  I wished above all not to leave myself time to think over the position I had accepted, [00:36.000 --> 00:41.120]  for, in spite of myself, it was a great distress to me. [00:41.120 --> 00:48.520]  Thus my life, generally so calm, assumed all at once an appearance of noise and disorder. [00:48.520 --> 00:53.800]  Never believe, however disinterested the love of a kept woman may be, that it will cost [00:53.800 --> 00:55.680]  one nothing. [00:55.680 --> 01:01.660]  Nothing is so expensive as their caprices, flowers, boxes at the theatre, suppers, days [01:01.660 --> 01:06.600]  in the country, which one can never refuse to one's mistress. [01:06.600 --> 01:09.440]  As I have told you, I had little money. [01:09.440 --> 01:14.080]  My father was, and still is, Receiver General at sea. [01:14.080 --> 01:19.400]  He has a great reputation there for loyalty, thanks to which he was able to find the security [01:19.400 --> 01:23.040]  which he needed in order to attain this position. [01:23.080 --> 01:29.680]  I came to Paris, studied law, was called to the bar, and, like many other young men, put [01:29.680 --> 01:36.720]  my diploma in my pocket, and let myself drift, as one so easily does in Paris. [01:36.720 --> 01:42.200]  My expenses were very moderate, only I used up my year's income in eight months and spent [01:42.200 --> 01:47.240]  the four summer months with my father, which practically gave me twelve thousand francs [01:47.240 --> 01:52.340]  a year, and, in addition, the reputation of a good son. [01:52.340 --> 01:55.580]  For the rest, not a penny of debt. [01:55.580 --> 02:00.100]  This, then, was my position when I made the acquaintance of Marguerite. [02:00.100 --> 02:06.460]  You can well understand that, in spite of myself, my expenses soon increased. [02:06.460 --> 02:11.980]  Marguerite's nature was very capricious, and, like so many women, she never regarded as [02:11.980 --> 02:17.620]  a serious expense those thousand and one distractions which made up her life. [02:17.660 --> 02:22.500]  So, wishing to spend as much time with me as possible, she would write to me in the [02:22.500 --> 02:27.900]  morning that she would dine with me, not at home, but at some restaurant in Paris, or [02:27.900 --> 02:29.500]  in the country. [02:29.500 --> 02:34.620]  I would call for her, and we would dine and go on to the theatre, often having supper [02:34.620 --> 02:36.100]  as well. [02:36.100 --> 02:40.580]  Forgive me if I give you all these details, but you will see that they were the cause [02:40.580 --> 02:42.620]  of what was to follow. [02:42.620 --> 02:47.740]  What I tell you is a true and simple story, and I leave to it all the naïveté of its [02:47.740 --> 02:52.620]  details and all the simplicity of its developments. [02:52.620 --> 02:58.260]  I realized, then, that as nothing in the world would make me forget my mistress, it was needful [02:58.260 --> 03:02.740]  for me to find some way of meeting the expenses into which she drew me. [03:02.740 --> 03:09.580]  Then, too, my love for her had so disturbing an influence upon me that every moment I spent [03:09.580 --> 03:14.780]  away from Marguerite was like a year, and that I felt the need of consuming these moments [03:14.780 --> 03:20.500]  in the fire of some sort of passion, as not to know that I was living them. [03:20.500 --> 03:25.500]  I began by borrowing five or six thousand francs on my little capital, and with this [03:25.500 --> 03:27.420]  I took to gambling. [03:27.420 --> 03:31.460]  Since gambling houses were destroyed, gambling goes on everywhere. [03:31.460 --> 03:37.220]  Formerly, when one went to Friscati, one had the chance of making a fortune, one played [03:37.220 --> 03:42.180]  against money, and if one lost, there was always the consolation of saying that one [03:42.180 --> 03:43.980]  might have gained. [03:43.980 --> 03:49.660]  Whereas now, except in the clubs, where there is still a certain rigor in regard to payments, [03:49.660 --> 03:55.740]  one is almost certain, the moment one gains a considerable sum, not to receive it. [03:55.740 --> 03:58.560]  You will readily understand why. [03:58.560 --> 04:03.540]  Gambling is only likely to be carried on by young people, very much in need of money, [04:04.380 --> 04:07.940]  the fortune necessary for supporting the life they lead. [04:07.940 --> 04:13.480]  They gamble then, and with this result, or else they gain, and then those who lose serve [04:13.480 --> 04:18.260]  to pay for their horses and mistresses, which is very disagreeable. [04:18.260 --> 04:23.420]  Debts are contracted, acquaintances begun about a green table end by quarrels in which [04:23.420 --> 04:29.860]  life or honor comes to grief, and though one may be an honest man, one finds oneself ruined [04:29.860 --> 04:37.140]  by very honest men, whose only defect is that they have not 200,000 francs a year. [04:37.140 --> 04:40.340]  I need not tell you of those who cheat at play. [04:40.340 --> 04:46.140]  I flung myself into this rapid, noisy, and volcanic life, which had formerly terrified [04:46.140 --> 04:50.840]  me when I thought of it, and which had become for me the necessary complement of my love [04:50.840 --> 04:52.620]  for Marguerite. [04:52.620 --> 04:54.860]  What else could I have done? [04:54.860 --> 05:00.540]  The nights that I did not spend in the Rue d'Antin, if I had spent them alone in my own room, [05:00.540 --> 05:02.500]  I could not have slept. [05:02.500 --> 05:07.060]  Jealousy would have kept me awake, and inflamed my blood and my thoughts. \""
